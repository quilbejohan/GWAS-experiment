A collection of 165 Lotus accessions from japan have been inoculated with a Synthetic Community containing 107 bacterial strains. This experiment has been repeated 3 times at 2 weeks intervals and plants were grown for 4 weeks. The rhizosphere has been harvested for each accession and an amplicon sequencing strategy targeting the 16S v5-v7 region allows us to calculate the relative abundances of the strains. These data have been used to perform GWAS analysis on different phenotypical values comprising individual strains abundances, family level abundances and overall microbiome profiles thanks to different ordination methods.
